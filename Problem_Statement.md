# Problem statement 
The objective of this project is to analyse and identify the key factors contributing to depression among students by examining their demographic information, academic performance, lifestyle habits, and family/mental health history. The aim is to uncover relationships that can help predict depression levels and inform strategies for early intervention.

Data Needed:
To address this question, the following data will be useful
1. Demographic information: Age, gender, and geographic region.  
2. Academic performance: CGPA, academic pressure, and study/job satisfaction.  
3. Lifestyle habits: Sleep duration, dietary habits, and work pressure.  
4. Mental health history: Family history of mental health issues and prior depression indicators.  
5. Target variable: Depression status (e.g., binary classification: Yes/No).  

Techniques to explore:
Techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature correlation analysis, and classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) will be applied to identify patterns in depression among students.
