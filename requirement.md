# Capstone Project
{Insert project name} Final Report
## Define the Problem Statement: Provide a well-defined problem statement that clearly articulates the goals, challenges, and potential benefits of your machine learning solution.

## Model Outcomes or Predictions: Identify the type of learning (classification or regression) and specify the expected output of your selected model. Determine whether supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms will be used.

## Data Acquisition: The deliverable at this step is to identify what data you plan to acquire and use with your model. For the best results, data should come from multiple sources and your analysis for including specific data should be clear. Please provide a clear visualization to assess the data’s potential to solve the problem as well.

### Data Preprocessing/Preparation: For this deliverable, you are tasked with detailing how you cleaned the data for your notebook. 
### What techniques did you use to ensure your data was free of missing values, and inconsistencies? 
### How did you split the data into training and test sets?
### Please include any necessary analysis and encoding steps you took as well.

## Modeling: For this deliverable, please document your selection of machine learning algorithms that you selected for your problem statement from the first deliverable.

## Model Evaluation: Share your model evaluation here. What types of models did you consider for your problem (classification, regression, unsupervised)?  Articulate the evaluation metrics you used and how you determined which model was most optimal for your problem.
