## Research Topic: Student Depression Analysis

### Research Question
What are the key factors contributing to depression among students, and how can they be used to predict depression levels for early intervention?

### Objective
The goal of this project is to explore and identify patterns in student depression by analyzing variables such as demographics, academic performance, lifestyle habits, and mental health history. The ultimate aim is to build a baseline predictive model and generate actionable insights for early support and intervention.

### Data Source
The analysis will use the Student Depression Dataset from Kaggle, which includes detailed student information across multiple dimensionsâ€”demographics, academic records, lifestyle choices, family mental health history, and depression status.

### Techniques to Be Used
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To uncover patterns, check data distributions, handle missing values, and visualize key trends.
2.Feature Correlation Analysis: To assess how variables such as sleep, academic pressure, and family mental health history relate to depression outcomes.
3.Baseline Machine Learning Model: A classification model will be implemented to predict depression status based on input features.

### Expected Outcomes
1.Identification of the most influential factors that correlate with student depression.
2.Development of a baseline model that can help flag at-risk students based on their profile.
3.Insights for stakeholders to implement targeted support programs, such as counseling, peer mentoring, or academic flexibility.

### Why This Matters
Depression among students is a rising concern that affects both academic and personal outcomes. Without early detection, many students face long-term psychological and academic challenges. This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for building supportive environments and proactive mental health interventions. If not addressed, the issue could lead to increased dropout rates and broader societal impact.
